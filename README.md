# Share Lantern to Lan Devices

## What's the purpose of this?

Since the ios version of [Lantern](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern) is long-overdue, I created this simple batch script to allow access to Lantern on ios devices.

1. You will need a PC (running windows) to serve as a proxy.
2. Download`share-lantern.bat` and run it.
3. Make sure both your PC and ios device are connected to the same LAN network (i.e. the same Wi-Fi).
4. On your ios device, go to Wi-Fi settings -> Configure Proxy.
5. Select "Manual" and type in the settings as displayed on `share-lantern.bat`.
6. Save. Be advised that you may need to change the proxy settings when your network envrionment changes. 
7. USE IT WELL!
